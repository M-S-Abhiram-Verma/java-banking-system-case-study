# Java Banking System Simulation

This repository contains a **console-based Banking System Simulation** developed as part of my **4th semester Java case study**.

The main objective of this project is to apply **core Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** in a practical way.

## 📌 Project Overview

The application simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and balance inquiry.  
Each account is protected using a **PIN-based verification system** to ensure secure access.

The program is menu-driven and runs through the command line.
